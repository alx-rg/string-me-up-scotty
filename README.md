### Creating an npm package and publishing said package

Publishing an update, as you have to update the version number!

Why? Getting a deeper understanding of npm and it's ecosystem + contributing to open source.

### Let's talk about SEMVer

The first digit is the MAJOR version. I update the "1" 1.0.0 if the updates are making the code incompatible with the previous version.

The second digit changes if the code is BACKWARDS compatible.

The third number is called a patch when you make bug fixes and improvements.

SEMVer = Semantic Versioning

If I want to publish:
npm publish (but make sure to update the version number appropriately)
